            Snooker  is a 
            cue sport played on a rectangular table covered with a green cloth 
            called baize, with six pockets, one at each corner and one in the middle 
            of each long side. First played by British Army officers stationed in India in
             the second half of the 19th century, the game is played with twenty-two balls, comprising
              a white cue ball, fifteen red balls, and six other balls—a yellow, green, brown, blue, pink, and black—collectively 
              called the colours. Using a cue stick, the individual players or teams take turns to strike the cue ball to pot other 
              balls in a predefined sequence, accumulating points for each successful pot and for each time the opposing player or 
              team commits a foul. An individual frame of snooker is won by the
             player who has scored the most points. A snooker match ends when a player reaches a predetermined number of frames.
